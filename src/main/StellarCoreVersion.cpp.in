Notes derived from https://developers.stellar.org/docs/run-core-node/installation#release-version

The version number scheme that we follow is protocol_version.release_number.patch_number where:
protocol_version is the maximum protocol version supported by that release (all versions are 100% backward compatible),
release_number is bumped when a set of new features or bug fixes not impacting the protocol are included in the release,
patch_number is used when a critical fix has to be deployed.

E.g. v17.0.0rc1-3-g871c5e1f-dirty
E.g. stellar-core 17.0.0 (096f6a766ed6aa08e13519371e842b90f01df841)
